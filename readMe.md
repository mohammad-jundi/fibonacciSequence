Fibonacci Sequence
Present your users a number input and generate a Fibonacci sequence from the value your users enter after clicking
on the Generate button. For example, if your users have entered 10 to the input, then you need to generate first
10 Fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34. You can list the numbers in the sequence with <li> tags.

Sum of Squares
Present your users a number input and allow them to add N other inputs with a button. After clicking the Calculate
button, you need to calculate the squares of those numbers and afterwards calculate the sum of them. Present the
final calculation to the user. For example, if your users clicked 3 times to "Add New Number" button and entered
three numbers 3, 6, 9, then your final calculation must be 9 + 36 + 81 = 126.

Palindrome Word
Present your users an input where they can enter a word or a sentence. After clicking on the Check button, compute
if the word or the sentence the user entered is a palindrome. For a word or sentence to be a palindrome, it must
be the same when you read it from left-to-right and right-to-left. For example, the word: "Anna" is a palindrome
but "Table" is not a palindrome. Display the result as true or false to your user.
